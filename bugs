code bugs:

Error with protractor syncing with Angular2 - 'Could not find testability for element'
when intializing the test file, this error displayed immediatly.
after research it was found to add these items to spec.js file:
    
    ignoreSynchronization = true;
    browser.waitForAngular();
    browser.driver.sleep(1000);


and the tests were able to complete.  any one of the three not added resulted in the same sync error.



syntax error on sendKeys - initially was 'sendyKeys'
removed the first 'y'
code ran.



failure to find element 'by.id'...
changed to 'by.css'
bug fixed.

failure to find element for clearTodo and Delete- intially set to 'clear-completed' and 'destroy'
changed to 'button.clear-completed' and 'button.destroy'
bug fixed.



outstanding bug:
Fields on TodoMVC are not being populated with expected data.
Example code requires input of 'CaMElcaSe'

Actual output is 'CaElSe'

intital research and suggested attempts failed.

This is still in troubleshooting stage.

this bug does not affect the app as the conditions were met.
